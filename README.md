This project involves configuring a network topology to ensure seamless connectivity across devices. The final goal is to access a website (http://netlab.kau) from multiple PCs and receive the same welcome page.



## Overview
The primary objective is to configure devices outside a predefined blue area in the network topology. This setup should ensure all PCs can access the specified website successfully.




## Prerequisites
1- Packet Tracer or equivalent network simulation software.

2- Admin Laptop to configure all devices.

3- Familiarity with basic network configuration commands.

## Configuration Steps
1- Setup Devices: Ensure all devices outside the blue area are powered on and interfaces are up.

2- Access Devices: Use the Admin Laptop to remotely or directly access each device for configuration.

3- Apply Configuration: Follow the provided configuration guide to set up each device. This includes setting IP addresses, VLAN configurations, trunking, routing, and more.

4- Save Configurations: After setting up each device, remember to save the configuration to the startup configuration


## Testing
1- Ping Test: Ensure all devices can ping their respective gateways and other devices within their VLAN/subnet.

2- Website Access: From PC1, PC2, and PC3, open a web browser and navigate to http://netlab.kau. All PCs should display the same welcome page.

## Tools & Resources
Packet Tracer: A network simulation tool used for visualization and testing.
